# TriviaMazeGame_Project

  The Husky Trivia Maze Game Project is the project of the TCSS360 Software Development And Quality Assurance Techniques course, in Fall 2021, at the University of Washington Tacoma. As a result, we could apply the knowledge we had learned from the class into our software. For example, we considered the software life cycle, naming and coding style,  user stories, iterations planning, Agile methodologies, and UML Class Diagrams. In addition, we estimated code smells and design patterns. Finally, we organized our code using the object-orientation principle.
